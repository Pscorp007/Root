1. Root Library through (CPP)
2. Bash scripting
3. Scrapping Data from CSV files and Analyse it through a Program written in CPP
4. Data Presentation using Tgraphs,histograms,Graphs etc.
5. Problem Solving, Basic Understanding of how physics problems are solved through Data Points only.

# Results are Presented: below in Graphical format:
