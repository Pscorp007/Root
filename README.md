A Cpp Program was deployed Using the CERN's opensource library Root, Root is required to present data in presentable
format for the users to analyze.
Key Learnings:
1. Root Library through (CPP)
2. Bash scripting
3. Scrapping Data from CSV files and Analyse it through a Program written in CPP
4. Data Presentation using Tgraphs,histograms,Graphs etc.
5. Problem Solving, Basic Understanding of how physics problems are solved through Data Points only.
